# 1. Due dates and submission details

See submission details below for all due dates and submission details. Note there are multiple submission parts.

# 2. Honor code

This assignment should be completed individually to maximize learning. It is important that you adhere to the Course Policies explained in detail at https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/cs149/coursepolicies/ listed under the section on Programming Assignments. Also relevant is the [JMU Honor Code](http://www.jmu.edu/honorcode/code.shtml).

# 3. Learning objectives

This programming assignment is designed to help you learn about (and assess
whether you have learned about):

* Writing moderately complicated algorithms.
* Organizing algorithms into re-usable methods.
* Writing methods with different return types.
* Organizing methods into re-usable classes.
* Bottom-up testing.

It is also intended to reinforce what you have already learned about relational operators, logical operators, `if` statements, and formatting output.

# 4. Background

_WeatherBits_ is a (fictitious) company that develops weather-related software of various kinds. They have asked you to develop an application that can calculate wind chill values. These data are being collected at weather stations throughout North America.

## 4.1. Weather stations

Each weather stations that _WeatherBits_ collects data from has a (four-character) International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) code that is used to identify it.

## 4.2. Units

The weather stations in Canada measure temperatures in degrees Celsius and wind velocities in kilometers per hour (km/h). The weather stations in Mexico measure temperatures in degrees Celsius and wind velocities in meters per second (m/sec). Finally, the weather stations in the United States measures temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit and wind velocities in miles per hr (mi/hr).

For this assignment, you must convert between temperature units as follows:

$f = (9.0 / 5.0 \cdot c) + 32.0$

$c = (5.0 / 9.0) \cdot (f - 32.0)$

where $f$ denotes the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and $c$ denotes the temperature in degrees Celsius.

Also for this assignment, you must assume that there are exactly 1.60934 kilometers per mile, 1000.0 meters per kilometer, and 3600.0 seconds per hour.

## 4.3. Wind chill calculations

Wind chill values are calculated differently in different parts of the world (and have been calculated differently in the past). For the purposes of this project, you must use the following formula that was developed for North American using "standard" units. Specifically, for air temperatures at or below 50 degrees F and wind velocities above 3 mph:

$w = 35.74 + 0.6215 \cdot t âˆ’ 35.75 \cdot v^{0.16} + 0.4275 \cdot t \cdot v^{0.16}$

where w denotes the wind chill value in degrees Fahrenheit, $t$ denotes the air temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, and $v$ denotes the wind velocity (or speed) in miles per hour. For other temperatures and wind speeds, the wind chill value must be the air temperature. Obviously, you will need to convert the temperatures and wind velocities from non-U.S. stations to "standard" units before you can use this equation.

# 5. Classes for this assignment

You must write four different classes, each of which is described below.

## 5.1. `Convert`

`Convert` is a utility class that can be used to perform conversions of various kinds. It must have the following methods (the purpose of which should be self-explanatory).

```java
public static double fromCelsiusToFahrenheit(double c)
public static double fromFahrenheitToCelsius(double d)
public static double fromKilometersToMiles(double km)
public static double fromMilesToKilometers(double km)
public static double fromMetersPerSecondToMilesPerHour(double mps)
public static double fromMilesPerHourToMetersPerSecond(double mph)
```

## 5.2. `Weather`

`Weather` is a utility class that can be used to perform weather calculations of various kinds. It must have the following methods.

```java
public static double windChill(double t, double v)
public static boolean isDangerous(double w)
```

`windchill()` must calculate the wind chill value from the temperature t (measured in degrees Fahrenheit) and the wind velocity `v` (measured in miles per hour) using the method described above.

`isDangerous()` must return `true` if the given wind chill, `w`, (measured in degrees Fahrenheit) is less than -20.0 and must return `false` otherwise. __It must not use an `if` statement, ternary operator, `switch` statement, or loop.__

## 5.3. `TerminalUI`

`TerminalUI` is a utility class that can be used to prompt the user for input and read the user's response. If you use the `JMUConsole` class for input and output then the `TerminalUI` class must have the following methods,

```java
public static double promptForDouble(String message, String units)
public static String promptForString(String message)
public static int promptForUnitlessInt(String message)
```

whereas if you use a `Scanner` object for input and the `System.out` object for output then the `TerminalUI` class must have the following methods.

```java
public static double promptForDouble(Scanner keyboard, String message, String units)
public static String promptForString(Scanner keyboard, String message)
public static int promptForUnitlessInt(Scanner keyboard, String message)
```

`promptForDouble()` must print the given message followed by the given units (in parentheses), read the user's response, and return it.

`promptForString()` and `promptForUnitlessInt()` must both print the given message, read the user's response, and return it. (Two methods are needed for this purpose because they have different return types).

## 5.4. `WindChillCalculator`

`WindChillCalculator` is the main class for the application. It must:

1. Prompt the user for the country and read the response.
2. Prompt the user for the the temperature (using the units that are appropriate to the country) and read the response.
3. Prompt the user for the wind speed (using the units that are appropriate to the country) and read the response.
4. Prompt the user for the ICAO code for the weather station and read the response.
5. Convert from local units to standard units.
6. Calculate the wind chill value in standard units.
7. Determine whether the wind chill value is dangerous or not.
8. Convert the wind chill value to local units.
9. Print the wind chill value (using the appropriate description of the local units).
10. Print the `String` literal `" (Be Careful!)"` if the wind chill value is considered dangerous.

Of course, it may also need to perform intermediate calculations. It need not validate the user's responses.

# 6. Sample Executions

The following input/output is illustrative of a single execution of the application for a station in Canada.

Wind Speed (Mi/Hr): <code class="rbio-input">3.0</code><br>
Station: <code class="rbio-input">KFVX</code><br>
Wind Chill for KFVX: 50.00 degrees F
</code>

# 7. Unit Testing

Though it is not required, you are strongly advised to test each method in each class individually, as you write it. Then, when you are sure that all of the individual methods are correct, you should test the entire application. __The instructors and teaching assistant may choose not to provide assistance if they believe that you have not made a serious attempt to test the individual methods before testing the complete application.__

You are being provided with the following test cases to encourage you to use unit testing.
