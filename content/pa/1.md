# Due Dates and Submission Details

See submission details below for all due dates and submission details. Note there are multiple submission parts.

# Honor Code

This assignment should be completed individually to maximize learning. It is important that you adhere to the [Course Policies](https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/cs149/coursepolicies/), particularly the [section on Programming Assignments](https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/cs149/coursepolicies/#assignment-policies). Also relevant is the [JMU Honor Code](http://www.jmu.edu/honorcode/code.shtml).

# Objectives

* Observe and categorize test cases for a simple calculation.
* Write a short textual algorithm for a simple calculation.
* Use a `Scanner` to read input of varying data types.
* Display output with the `print()` and `println()` methods.
* Use escape characters in output.
* Perform a simple calculation with multiple variables.
* Apply command-line tools to evaluate program style.

# Introduction

A new program is being started at JMU for promoting health and wellness called the Duke Dog Dinner Discount. (Note this program is not real, but there are companies that have programs that are not so different.) People eating dinner at any of the JMU cafeterias can get a 10% discount if they enter in their personal information and become informed on what their overall BMR (basic metabolic rate) in kilocalories/day would be according to the latest prediction formula, called the Mifflin St. Jeor Equation. (See [wikipedia BMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate#BMR_estimation_formulas) for more information.) Always looking to save a bit, the university cut their costs by getting only an interface to the hardware built by an outside company. In the JMU tradition they are involving the student body by asking our first year programming class to provide the calculations for the system.

The calculation the university has specified to be used for the BMR calculation is the [Mifflin St. Jeor Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate#BMR_estimation_formulas): `BMR = (10.0m/1kg + 6.25h/1cm - 5.0a/1yr + s)`, where:

* `m` is mass in kilograms
* `h` is height in centimeters
* `a` is age in years
* `s` is +5 for males and -161 for females

The user will enter their mass in kilograms and height in centimeters as measured by a scale and height chart in the dinner line, along with their age and their "preferred s-value". Your program will print prompts for each of these values, calculate the user's BMR from the user's input and then print their BMR, weight in pounds, and height in meters and centimeters. 

Before implementing your program in java, complete:


1. the readiness quiz for PA1-A, and 
1. the textual algorithm quiz for PA1-B. 

Reviewing the <code class="rbio-input">input</code> and <code class="rbio-output">output</code> will give you the general idea. When implementing the java code, create a new source file named `BMRCalculator.java`, and implement the entire program in the main method. Provide a meaningful javadoc comment, including `@author` and `@version` tags, and remove unnecessary comments such as "add your code here." Write concise inline comments (using `//`) for each major section of the assignment described below (e.g., gathering input, doing calculations, displaying output). You should have these comments in place before writing any code! These comments should correlate to statements in your textual algorithm.

# Reading Input
Your program will need to read and store a variety of information while displaying the prompts as shown in the following example:


<code><code class="rbio-output">Enter your mass (weight in kilograms): </code><code class="rbio-input">55.5</code><br>
<code class="rbio-output">Enter your height (in centimeters): </code><code class="rbio-input">162</code><br>
<code class="rbio-output">Enter your age (in years): </code><code class="rbio-input">19</code><br>
<code class="rbio-output">Enter your "preferred s-value": </code><code class="rbio-input">5</code></code>


1. Read in the mass as a decimal number.
1. Read in the height in centimeters as an integer number.
1. Read in the age as an integer number.
1. Read in the s-value as an integer number.


To get started, declare variables with meaningful names and types. Initialize a `Scanner` to handle the input, and use `System.out.print()` to display each prompt exactly as shown. There is no need to handle invalid user input in this assignment.

# Calculating 
## BMR, weight in pounds, and height in meters and centimeters
<ol start="5">
    <li>Use the variables defined in the input to implement the formula for BMR shown above.</li>
    <li>Convert the mass in kilograms into the weight in pounds. Use the conversion factor <code>1 kilogram = 2.20462 pounds</code>.</li>
    <li>Convert the `height in centimeters` into `meters and centimeters` each represented as integers. Each value should be computed by using one java arithmetic operator.</li>
</ol>

# Displaying Output

<ol start="8">
    <li>Use the collected data to display the output <em><strong>exactly</strong></em> as shown. <strong>Make sure there is one blank line between the input statements shown above and the output statements below.</strong></li>
</ol>

<code class="rbio-output">Your BMR is 1477.5 kilocalories per day.<br>
You weigh 122.35640999999998 pounds.<br>
You are 1 meters and 62 centimeters tall.</code>

Note that you may have results with many decimal places for the BMR and pounds double values. Don't worry about that at this point. We will learn how to format those values later. 

# Submission

Submission for this assignment is divided into three parts that should be completed in order.

* **PA1-A: Readiness Quiz: due Friday, 9/8 11:00 pm**
    * To complete Part A you should first carefully read the project specification. Once you feel confident that you have a good grasp of the project requirements, log into Canvas and complete the Part A readiness quiz. YOU MUST ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS CORRECTLY (earn 100%) TO GET ANY CREDIT FOR THIS PART. You may take the quiz as many times as necessary but if you do not complete it on time, you will receive zero credit.
* **PA1-B: Algorithm Quiz: due Monday, 9/11 11:00 pm**
    * After reading the specification and doing the quiz, you should complete the algorithm quiz in Canvas.   Note that you only have one submission opportunity for this quiz so be careful taking it. NO LATE SUBMISSIONS WILL RECEIVE CREDIT FOR THIS PART!
* **PA1-C: Java Implementation: due Friday, 9/15 11:00 pm**
    * PA-1 C is a Web-CAT file submission.
        * -25% before Saturday, 9/16 11:00 pm
        * -50% before Sunday, 9/17 11:00 pm
        * **Not accepted after Sunday, 11:00 pm**
        * You must implement steps 1-8 in java, creating a file called `BMRCalculator.java`. Before uploading your `BMRCalculator.java` file, be sure to complete the following steps carefully:

<ol start="9">
    <li>Verify that your code is working. You should test it with several of your own tests, but included here are a <a href="/cs149/files/pa1test.in">pa1test.in</a> and a <a href="/cs149/files/pa1test.exp">pa1test.exp</a> to give you one verified command-line test. Note if your output is not exactly like the output in `pa1test.exp` when run on `pa1test.in`, then your code is not correct.</li>
    <li>Make sure all your variables are declared at the beginning of the `main()` method, before any other statements.</li>
    <li>Check that you have inserted the proper javadoc `@author` and `@version` comments in the appropriate header.</li>
    <li>Run Checkstyle and eliminate ALL warnings about your code.</li>
</ol>

# Grading
Your submissions will be graded according to the following criteria. ***Note .java files that do not compile will result in a grade of zero for Part C.***

* Part A: Readiness Quiz: `10%`
* Part B: Algorithm: `10%`
* Part C: Checkstyle: `10%`
* Part C: Instructor grading based on style and code quality: `10%`
* Part C: Correctly scanned input: `20%`
* Part C: Correctly formatted output: `20%`
* Part C: Correct calculations: `20%`
