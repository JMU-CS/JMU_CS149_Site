# Our Course Text: Think Java

<img src="/cs149/img/ThinkJava.png" style="width: 25%; height: 25%; float: left; margin: 24px; ">

Allen Downey and Chris Mayfield (2017). _Think Java: How to Think Like a
Computer Scientist._ 2nd Ed. Green Tea Press, Needham, MA.

This course is specifically designed to complement the most current version of
Think Java, which was just completed in summer 2017. The book is designed to be
a readable guide for students just learning to think like computer scientists.
If you don’t like the book, however, we won’t be offended. You are certainly welcome to use additional resources. See the [resources page](/cs149/resources/) for more information.
