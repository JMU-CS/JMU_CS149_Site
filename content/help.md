# Piazza

We have set up a common Piazza forum that is shared among all sections, TAs, and
instructors.

## Overview

[Piazza](https://piazza.com/) is a free, community-based
question and answer platform. This course uses Piazza to ask and
answer questions that might be of value to a large number of
students in the course.

If you would like to participate, you must register with Piazza
(if you have not already done so). You are not required to do so.


## Appropriate Use

You should only use Piazza for generic questions and answers. So, it
is appropriate to ask/answer questions about things that were
discussed in lecture or things you read. It is even appropriate to
ask/answer clarification questions about programming assignment.
However, it is not appropriate to ask questions about source code that
you have written for a programming assignment or for an answer to a
question to include source code written for an assignment. Also, it
is inappropriate to ask questions or give answers that might unduly
help another student complete a programming assignment. Such questions
and answers contain "spoilers" that tend to subvert the learning
process rather than assist it.

If you are not sure whether a question/answer is appropriate, use email
to ask the instructor before posting it.


## Process

Before using Piazza, try to find the answer on your own. Then, and only
then, you should use Piazza as follows.

Piazza should be used as follows.

1. Check to see if your question has already been answered. (It's
annoying to ask questions that have already been answered and embarrassing
for the answer to be
[let me Google that for you](https://lmgtfy.com).)
2. Draft your question. (In your question you should describe what you
know about the answer. For example, "I know the problem isn't X because I've
already tried Y." 
3. Proofread your question.
4. Post your question.

Remember not to post new questions in the discussion of an
existing question because it will only be noticed by people who
happen to be following the discussion.
