This page contains the course policies that are common to all sections of CS 149
in the fall semester of 2017. __Additional policies pertaining to your specific
section and instructor__ can be found on your instructor's syllabus (see
    the [home page](/) for links).

# Assignment Policies

In addition to acquiring some skills and undergoing some emotional
growth, to succeed in this course, as in most Computer Science
courses, you must be able to:

* Remember and understand facts and concepts;
* Use these facts/concepts to solve novel problems; and
* Evaluate alternative solutions to the same problem.

In other words, neither a good memory nor the ability to search
through existing sources of information, is enough to succeed in this
course. To succeed, you must become a creative problem solver, and the
various assignments are designed with this in mind.

# Exams

Examinations are the primary assessment mechanism in this course. They
are designed to enable both us and you determine what you do and do
not understand.

There will be three exams. All exams will have a hand-written portion
and a computer-based portion, both of which will be in-class. For the
hand-written portion you will be required to answer knowledge-based
questions, code-tracing questions, and short code-writing
questions. For the computer-based portion you will be required to
write medium-sized pieces of code that must pass various tests for you
to receive credit.

The first exam will account for 15% of your course grade, the second
will account for 25% of your course grade, and the final exam will
account for 35% of your course grade (subject to the caveat discussed in the
section on course grades).

Except in extraordinary situations, you will not be excused from
exams. Your instructor will be the sole arbiter of whether a situation
qualifies as extraordinary. Hence, you should behave as if you will
not be excused from exams for any reason.


# Programming Assignments

Programming assignments are primarily an instructional mechanism, not
an assessment mechanism. Nonetheless, programming assignments will be
graded and, in fact, will be graded strictly. There are two reasons
for this. First, the grades will provide you with an assessment of how
well you know the material. Second, experience has shown that
beginning Computer Science students do not always make decisions that
are in their own best interest, and often do not complete ungraded
assignments.

In other words, in this course, programming assignments are designed
to: (1) help you learn the materials; (2) help you understand what you
have and have not learned; and (3) encourage you to do the work that
is necessary for learning to occur. Unambiguously, the best way for
you to achieve the second objective is for you to complete programming
assignments entirely on your own, occasionally asking questions of a
general nature (i.e., about the topics you need to understand in order
to complete assignment but not specifics about the assignment
itself). However, for some students, collaboration aids in achieving
the first objective.

Hence, you may discuss programming assignments with other students who
are currently enrolled in CS149, but you should limit the amount of
collaboration and you should keep a careful record of it (so that you
can assess yourself). You must not discuss the programming assignments
with students who are not currently enrolled in CS149, except for the
designated lab assistants. You also must not discuss programming
assignments with tutors of any kind -- paid or volunteer, local or
remote. Finally, you must not submit (even before the due date/time)
another student's work as your own. In other words, the code you
submit must be written/typed entirely by you and you alone. Failure to
comply with these policies is a violation of the JMU Honor Code.

Though you are entitled to discuss the programming assignments with
other people, you must be courteous. Most importantly, students are
not required, or even encouraged, to provide assistance. So, if asked,
you should feel free to decline such a request and, if asking, you
must not take offense if such a request is denied. In addition,
neither the instructor(s) nor lab assistant(s) may provide as much
assistance as you want. Most frequently, this happens when they think
the assistance you have requested will prevent you from learning an
important concept. Sometimes, this happens when they think you are
using too much of their time. Again, you must not take offense if a
request is denied.

Solutions to programming assignments may be submitted up to 48 hours
after the due date/time but will be penalized. Those submitted within
24 hours will be penalized 25% and those submitted within 48 hours
will be penalized 50%. Any solution to a programming assignment that
is submitted 48 hours or more after the due date/time will receive a
grade of 0.


# Labs, Homework Assignments, and Activities

Throughout the semester, you will be given various labs, homework
assignments, in-class activities, etc¡­ to complete, the exact nature
of which will vary from section to section. In total, they will
account for 10% of your final grade. Make sure you understand your
section¡¯s policies regarding these labs/assignments/activities/etc...


# Course Grades

Numeric grades will be converted to letter grades using the
"traditional" approach. That is, numeric grades between 90% and 100%
will be converted to a letter grade in the "A" range, numeric grades
between 80% and 89% will be converted to a letter grade in the "B"
range, numeric grades between 70% and 79% will be converted to a
letter grade in the "C" range, numeric grades between 60% and 69% will
be converted to a letter grade in the "D" range, and numeric grades of
less than 60% will be converted to an "F". "+" and "-" grades will be
used at the instructor's discretion.

However, note that if you do not earn 60% of the points on the final
exam you will receive a letter grade no higher than C for the course.

# Required textbook

<img src="/cs149/img/ThinkJava.png" style="width: 25%; height: 25%; float: left; margin: 24px; ">

In this course we are using the latest edition of

Allen Downey and Chris Mayfield (2017). _Think Java: How to Think Like a
Computer Scientist._ 2nd Edition. Green Tea Press, Needham, MA.

which has just been completed this summer.

This course aligns with Prof. Mayfield's free and open-source textbook. The pdf
is available online, or you may purchase an inexpensive hard copy. There are many
ways to acquire the latest version of the textbook online for free, and affordable
printed copies are available via the JMU bookstore. For more information, see the [book's page](/book/).

# University Policies

## Adding / Dropping

You are responsible for enrolling in courses and verifying your schedule on
MyMadison. The deadline for adding a semester course is Thursday, mm/dd/2017
(signatures required after Tuesday, mm/dd/2017). The last day to withdraw from a
course with a W grade is Friday, mm/dd/2017.

## Disability Services

If you have a documented disability and need accommodations in this course,
please register with the Office of Disability Services
([http://www.jmu.edu/ods](http://www.jmu.edu/ods), Student Success Center, Room
1202, 540-568-6705). They will provide you with an Access Plan Letter to verify
your need for services and make recommendations for the course. I will be happy
to discuss your access plan with you.

## Excused Absences

Students who are unable to attend class due to JMU sponsored activities (such as
sports, band, academic competition, field trips, etc.) or personal religious
observances may request reasonable accommodations. Please notify your instructor
during the first week of class regarding potential absences so that we can
determine alternative methods for you to complete the required work.

## University Closings

For severe weather and other unexpected circumstances, watch for announcements
relating to make-up work. See [http://www.jmu.edu/JMUpolicy/1309.shtml](http://www.jmu.edu/JMUpolicy/1309.shtml)
for JMU’s cancellation policy. Although the schedule may adapt to canceled
classes, assignment deadlines generally do not change.
